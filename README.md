# Refactoring Evaluation

## Complexity Overview

### Time Complexity

Estimates algorithm runtime based on input size (big O notation).

### Space Complexity

Estimates memory usage based on input size (big O notation).

## Program Analysis

### Before Refactoring:

- **Operations:** Mainly in `while` loop.
- **Count:** Primarily linear, O(n).
  
### After Refactoring:

- **Operations:** Mainly in `while` loop, control structure changed.
- **Count:** Remains primarily linear, O(n).
